// This file has been deactivated as part of the refactoring to a client-side sidebar pipeline.
// The original content was causing issues with Next.js 15 / React Server Components
// by passing functions (React components for icons) from a Server Component to a Client Component.
// The functionality should now be handled by a client-side AppShell and its internal Sidebar.
